# PVSTravel - Admin
The goal of this project was to develop an admin application that displays and manages ordered Travel Packages from the main PVSTravel application. The admin panel allows administrators to efficiently monitor and process orders placed by users, ensuring smooth operations within the system.

This application complements the main PVSTravel project, which focuses on representing travel packages and itineraries offered by travel agencies. In PVSTravel - Admin, administrators can view all orders, track their statuses/details, and manage associated data for each order, such as exporting all ordered Travel Packages, or creating an invoice for each package.

The application was built using ASP.NET MVC, providing a structured and scalable architecture. It integrates seamlessly with the main PVSTravel system, ensuring a unified experience for managing travel packages and orders.
